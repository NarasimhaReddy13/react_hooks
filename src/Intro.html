Hooks dont't work in class components

Must call in top level

Don't call hooks from regular JS Functions, in react --- don't call -- inside loops conditions, nested Functions 

// useState --- state is isolated ( it will not merge automatically ) -- replace the state
-- If we won't mention in useState() --- takes as undefined by default

// useEffect ---- Must pass 2nd argument -- ( [] ) -- otherwise when making api calls it will done infinite times

componentDidMount() -- useEffect, componentDidUpdate() -- dependency Array
componentWillUmount() -- giving the return callback function in useEffect


// useReducer --- same as redux functionality --- dealing with more complex state changes in react

// useMemo --- memorized value
